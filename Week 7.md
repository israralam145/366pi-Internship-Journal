# Week 7 (7th August - 11th August, 2023)
Here's my journey for week 7. This week, I'm working on coding the email signature layout and its implementation in different email services like Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail.

# Friday, 11th August
<h3>Plan</h3>

* Working on implementation on Outlook.
* Fixing the layout in Outlook because the format is not the same as Gmail.

<h3>Progress</h3>

* .svg icons are not supported in Outlook. So I had to use .png icons.
* Changed the QR and Profile image in base64 format.


# Thursday, 10th August
<h3>Plan</h3>

* Working on the implementation of the email signature.

<h3>Progress</h3>

* layout not working in the Gmail signature 
  * I had to redesign but I had difficulties as the table layout is very complex and challenging.
* Some elements going outside the parent table.
  * Working on it.
* I have noticed that DM Sans and Nunito fonts are not working in the Gmail signature.
  * So I had to use Sans-Serif font.
