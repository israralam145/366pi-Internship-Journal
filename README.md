<h1>My Experience</h1>
This is my journey of internship in 366pi Technology, a  Harmu.
An amazing place with a good environment to work. Since I'm working and contributing for the first time in any company and my experience is very good. They have a very nice infrastructure and team.
Throughout the internship, I've learned a lot of new things that I couldn't through the course. They have such a great team.
