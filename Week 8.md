# Week 8 (14th August - 18th August, 2023)

<h4>Last Week plans- </h4>https://github.com/israralam145/366pi-Internship-Journal/blob/main/Week%207.md

# Wednesday, 16th August
<h3>Plan</h3>
* Implementing signature on Gmail

<h3>Progress</h3>
* When I copy paste the signature in the gmail signature textbox, it says signature is too long, try shorter one. I think the problem is the code which exceeds the character limit of the gmail signature while it accepts inn outlook.
* I couldn't find the solution.

# Monday, 14th August
<h3>Plan</h3>

* Working on the flow of the email signature.
* Finalizing the templates.
<h3>Progress</h3>

* One major issue encountered. Gmail doesn't allow embedding base64 encoded images for security reasons while in Outlook, it's working.
* I'm researching it. Hope I'll find a way to solve this issue.
* I was using a local file address for the image files. So that, the recipient does not receive the image. It was a very noob practice. Fixed that too.
