# Monday, 14th August
<h3>Plan</h3>

* Working on the flow of the email signature.
* Finalizing the templates.
<h3>Progress</h3>

* Gmail doesn't allow embedding base64 encoded images for security reasons while in Outlook, it's working.
* I'm researching it. Hope I'll find a way.
* I was using a local file address for the image files. So that, the recipient does not receive the image. It was a very noob practice. Fixed that too.
