# Week 8 (14th August - 18th August, 2023)

<h4>Last Week plans- </h4>https://github.com/israralam145/366pi-Internship-Journal/blob/main/Week%207.md

# Friday, 18th August
<h3>Plan</h3>

* Got a new task today to work on the UI elements in [BetterPlanetTogether](https://betterplanettogether.org/) site.

<h3>Progress</h3>

* Started working on it.

# Thursday, 17th August
<h3>Plan</h3>

* Working on the Email signature.

<h3>Progress</h3>

* I couldn't find any way to implement this. Nothing is impossible. Its a very challenging for me. I'll keep working on it.

# Wednesday, 16th August
<h3>Plan</h3>

* Implementing signature on Gmail

<h3>Progress</h3>

* When I copy and paste the signature in the Gmail signature textbox, it says the signature is too long, try a shorter one. I think the problem is the code that exceeds the character limit of the Gmail signature as the base64 image has too many characters in the code. Meanwhile, it accepts in Outlook.
* Haven't tried Apple Mail since I do not have Apple ID.
* I couldn't find the solution.

# Monday, 14th August
<h3>Plan</h3>

* Working on the flow of the email signature.
* Finalizing the templates.
<h3>Progress</h3>

* One major issue encountered. Gmail doesn't allow embedding base64 encoded images for security reasons while in Outlook, it's working.
* I'm researching it. Hope I'll find a way to solve this issue.
* I was using a local file address for the image files. So that, the recipient does not receive the image. It was a very noob practice. Fixed that too.
