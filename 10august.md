# 10th August
* Working on the implementation of email signature.
* layout not working in the Gmail signature 
  * I had to redesign but i had difficulties as the table layout is very complex and challenging.
* Some elements going outside the parent table.
  * Working on it.
* I have noticed that DM Sans and Nunito fonts are not working in the Gmail signature.
  * So I had to use Sans-Serif font.
