# Monday, 22nd August
<h3>Plan</h3>

* Working on the responsiveness of the site.
* Adding some small UI elements.
<h3>Progress</h3>

* I'm having issues embedding twitter hashtag because twitter doesn't allow hashtag timeline. It only shows button. 

# Monday, 21st August
<h3>Plan</h3>

* Working on the new UI of [Know the SDGs](https://betterplanettogether.org/KnowSDGs#) page.
<h3>Progress</h3>

* contents have been added and hover elements are added where when the mouse hovers over the SDG images, a preview will be shown in a different container with text.
* Added required padding and alignments to look the UI more appealing.
* The site is not much responsive - Working on it.
* Text is too large and the container is overflowing to the container - Fixed.
